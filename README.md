Simple loader animation in pure CSS
===================================

Effect
------
![Screen capture](loader.gif?raw=true)

How it works
------------
Use DIV scale and animation
Create 6 DIVs with height of 10px and play animation to change the scale by 4.
Animation is delayed DIV by DIV to give the wave effect.
